The friendship paradox is the phenomenon that in social networks,
people on average have fewer friends than their friends do. The
generalized friendship paradox is an extension to attributes other
than the number of friends. The friendship paradox and its generalized
version have gathered recent attention due to the information they
provide about network structure and local inequalities. In this paper,
we propose several measures of nodal qualities which capture different
aspects of their activities and influence in online social networks.
Using these measures we analyse the prevalence of the generalized
friendship paradox over Twitter and we report high levels of prevalence
(up to over 90% of nodes). We contend that this prevalence of the
friendship paradox and its generalized version arise because of the
hierarchical nature of the connections in the network. This hierarchy
is nested as opposed to being star-like. We conclude that these
paradoxes are collective phenomena not created merely by a minority
of well-connected or high-attribute nodes. Moreover, our results
show that a large fraction of individuals can experience the
generalized friendship paradox even in the absence of a significant
correlation between degrees and attributes.
